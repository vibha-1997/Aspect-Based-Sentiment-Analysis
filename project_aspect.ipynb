Currently if I use the laptop I can't sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs. I did contact HP and share how unhappy I am. Well, they don't care a bunch. But, at the same time they (the company) would not and could not do anything about my problem. I would \\xa0say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful.

I constantly had to send my laptop in for services every 3 months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed. Toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another, and I am not kidding you, I called different hours of the day and you'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again, since they make it sound like they don't have your history list of your calls right in front of them. It's a long and tirring process that after a while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them. And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended). Long story short, since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one, I didn't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop, but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year, they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services, they finally gave in.

The Windows 7 Starter is, in my opinion, a great way to think about using your netbook: basics, basics, basics. I wiped nearly everything off of it, installed OpenOffice and Firefox, and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price. This netbook is a perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop (my wife and I have another laptop), or if you are a user who uses the computer for simple tasks. I use this for my tutoring business, and since I'm always bouncing from student to student, it is ideal for portability and battery life (yes, it gets the 8 hours as advertised!). Finally, I should note that I took the 2GB RAM stick from my old EeePC and installed it before I even powered on for the first time.

It's extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive (who uses those anymore anyways) so it easily fits into any college students bag.

It doesn't get heated up much even after continuous usage. But the  touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever I am typing, my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it's really annoying. I prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad, i always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else. HP please fix it.

I bought this laptop so that the entire family had a computer in the living room; the two of us use it regularly. I wanted something that had a new Intel Core processors and HDMI port so that we could hook it up directly to our TV. The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features. The screen is bright and the keyboard is nice; I find myself using the 10-key more than I thought I would. Battery is lasting about 6 hours as I am surfing the web on Sundays while checking football scores and watching funny Youtube videos. For those that care about noise this thing doesn't really make any; the i3 processor doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on. I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it. I wish Toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the OS at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff. Once I removed all the software the laptop loads in 15-20 seconds. This is not a serious gaming laptop or a serious media machine; my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn't require a dedicated video card.

They gave me a hard time yet again, but their was a malfunction in the battery itself, it didn't die. THEN, one month after the warranty expired, the replacement charger went. I had to pay $100 for a universal charger for this cheap $300 laptop. Not worth it one bit. The people are frustrating to work with, the product itself is very cheaply made, and the accessories are less than satisfactory. Also, my sister got the exact same laptop (since they were so cheap) and after 8 months, the screen split in half just from everyday use.

I called their repair depot as was told they would send Me a new box to return the computer to the repair depot.

The computer could have been shipped by Priority Mail through the USPS for the same cost and arrived by Noon on Tue. Instead it is sitting in West Verginia waiting for UPS to take two days to send Me a box and Two days for them to ship the computer some 691 miles by air? to Louisville Ky. By Air sounds more like by truck to Me. And Toshiba is totally unconcerned. The reaction of Toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter. We don't Mind and You don't Matter.

If you want to game, this thing can handle League of Legends on medium-low settings, but I certainly wouldn\\'t recommend it for gaming. Overall, a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web-browsing. Would definitely recommend for those who are \"technologically ignorant\"',\n",

Once open, the leading edge is razor sharp. This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design. Using this machine is like a mild form of torture. In the shop, these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it, get it home, break the seal and use it (very clever con). The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare. I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening. Also, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it. I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would. It is absolutely horrible to use, despite all its so called advanced features. I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use. Buy this if you like being tortured, teased, frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac. It's a bummer and one out of five is being kind. My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary. I'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible. In due course, I'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.\",\n",

I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college. I use the computer to basically check emails, surf the web, print coupons and for my college papers. I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC. It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow. My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and ordered my Apple. Yes, I thought the expese was a little much, but I now realize you get what you pay for. I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use. I've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful, english speaking (from Vancouver) techs that walked me through the processes to help me.

Call tech support, standard email the form and fax it back in to us. I called back to ensure that received it, they had. But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!! Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time. This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped. Asked the customer service rep. If it's not shipped on the next business day, called on a Friday they are closed on weekends, what was the next step. The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question. Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site. I'm tired of the inept service. If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS!!! Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small. I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE. HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!! I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter, so it's not just an isolated incident!!!\",\n",

I burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so I can place it there. I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times. This is what they told me: It heats up, and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops, and simply categorize them as portables. You might think, I am new in this game, but I am a gadget lover, and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years, and none gets this hot, that fast. I also experience the same with my MacBook Air. So you might ask, what did Apple do for me? For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this). Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby. The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.

In two months, both the power cord pin broke (the company replaced it) and then the CD drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into a million pieces. In addition, no matter what I do to change the settings, add/delete Flash, etc., Firefox hangs on start-up. It seems like Lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on. The cords always feel like they are in my way. One positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard, which is larger than usual. It's a pleasure to type on. My final thoughts: if you are a Mac user, stay away. If you want to travel with this laptop, don't buy it. It's clunky, heavy, and a pain to start up and shut down. If you have zero dollars, consider it. If you want ease of use and long-term happiness, buy a Macbook.\",\n",

The problem I had with this unit was unresolvable. It had a cooling system malfunction after 10 minutes of general use, and would not move past this error. I realize that not every unit has this issue, but the ones that do cannot be repaired. I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card, but still requires a return. Instead of taking another chance on Toshiba, I went with an Asus G73JH-x3. They offer the best warranty in the business, and don't 3rd party it out like Toshiba. For the same price, you get a lot more in the Asus....1920x1080 res./ awesome cooling system/ much better grafics card (ATI 5870) / 8GB RAM/ LED backlit screen...

They would repair one thing, send it back and it would still have the same problem. The processor went on me, the fan went and the motherboard went. I wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused, because they knew it was trouble. I had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty. I took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and I finally paid about 1500 for the extended warranty. I sent it back AND THEY LOST IT. I waited and waited and no laptop. Finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to a Walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box. I waited another month for approval and for them to \"BUILD\" me a new laptop. I was psyched. I thought all my problems would finally be solved being that my old computer wouldn\\'t go onto our wireless network and I wouldn\\'t have the same problems because it was updated. Here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing. HP didn\\'t fix it. I swear they design these things to go to crap after a year so you are stuck and have to buy a new one.

In addition, all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations. This comes in very handy for me as an educator. iPhotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos. It allows you to automatically upload photos to your Facebook account with one click. In addition, there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture.

The reviews at the time in late July 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review... The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus. Now the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic (medium low grade) plastic. So if you don't have kids, or not in high school or don't accidently sit on it, it should be fine. Now the speed is disappointing. Start up is fine  maybe 20 secs at most, but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times. Even for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open. I tried all the Window updates (this worked for a couple of HP laptops I7in that I bought later at BB) to see if it could remove the drag, it did not. Really at this point I am trying to confirm if the RAM can be upgraded to see if I can do that to help. Couple that with lack of inbuilt Bluetooth, dvd drive you are looking at a close tie (or even a loss) compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late August 2014. The HP laptops 17in (with i3 core and AMD) I mentioned before from the other big electronic BB store smoked this one even before I updated windows and upped the RAM.

The first one I had was a 2006 model, not the Pro. I fell in love with it. This one has had the same effect. I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion, so I kind of knew what I was getting, but hadn\\'t been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features. The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive. The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior. The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful. It is everything I\\'d hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy. For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy. It\\'s still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook. The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness. My real problem with it? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it\\'s a lie. I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it. The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours. Enabling the battery timer is useless. The \"Time remaining\" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes. It\\'s a joke. It\\'s so bad that I\\'m thinking I only got half a battery or something. I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like. This ain\\'t it.

The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp. The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well. I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations (similar to Microsoft Office).

Overall, a high quality laptop and a great value considering all this computer has to offer.',\n",
       " ' I get a ton of compliments on its size, and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on a bus, I can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you\\'re restricted to the width of your body for computing room. Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings). I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home, and it runs just fine. I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive. The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16\" laptop does. I wouldn\\'t play a first-person shooter with this, mind, but if you wanted to run MS Office, email, chat, download a video, listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store, and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in, I\\'d highly recommend checking this out. The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I\\'d stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week. Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user\\'s liking.',\n",
       " \" The Macbook is a fantastic laptop. This is the first macbook I have ever had. I came from the Dell Laptops and now I am so glad I switched when I needed a new laptop. The macbooks are small enough to be very portable yet hold tons of information and performance. Although the price is higher then Dell laptops, the Macbooks are worth the dough. You will love this macbook if you choose to buy it. The macbook rarely requires a hard reboot. It just works flawlessly! Its hard to encounter a problem on a mac that would require such abrupt action. Dells are ok, HPs aren't that good, but Macs or Fantastic. I honestly love my mac, thats why I am a self proclaimed mac addict. If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.\",\n",
       " \" I'm glad I made the choice to switch and buy this MAC. The benefits were immediate! Awesome graphics! Applications respond immediately (not like the tired MS applications). I can actually get work done with this MAC, and not fight with it like my tired old PC laptop. The magnetic plug-in power charging power cord is great (I even put it to the test by accident)- excellent innovation! The Apple applications (ex.iPhoto) are fun, easy, and really cool to use (unlike the competition)! After doing CAD work all day at work, using a higher end PC, I couldn't come home and settle for the use of a lower end computer. This laptop rocks (only wish it could run SolidWorks CAD - which Apple doesn't support)! I've saved a lot of time and headaches so far, using my new MacBook Pro. I am definitely sold, and not going back to PCs for home use!\",\n",
       " \" I've had this laptop for about a month now. It has served my needs quite nicely for the most part. The 2 GB of RAM is plenty, able to run Windows 7 and at least 2 or 3 other programs with next to no slowdown. The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft. My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in. This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range. Other than that, I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent gaming capabilities.\",\n",
       " \" My MacBook is probably the best investment I have ever made. I have had it for almost four years now and I have only had a few problems with it. The most recent being that my Safari internet browser is freaking out on me, but I have just been using firefox instead. If you had PC for four years I can almost gaurentee that something would of gone wrong by now, maybe even forcing you to replace your entire computer. I love this computer. Its small enough where I can take it pretty much anywhere, but still has a big enough screen to get everything done. Everything is so easy to use, Mac software is just so much simpler than Microsoft software. The only thing that I don't like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that I want to be able to run and I am not able to. Games being the main issue. It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I can't play it because its not compatable with the software. I feel that enough people have Macs these days and that companies need to start making things more compatable than they used to be. Other than that I don't have one complaint in the world!\",\n",
       " \" I have used both PCs and Macs and I have to say that I really really love my Mac Book Pro. While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at, I think there's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs. Everything from the design to the OS is simple and to the point. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!\",\n",
       " \" It allows me to do everything I need from a computer and more. With awesome graphics and assuring security, it's perfect! The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to, but overall it's worth it! I'd recommend this laptop to anyone!\",\n",
       " \" This is without a doubt the worst laptop I've ever had. I wavered between another Toshiba and this and ended up choosing this and I'm so sorry I did. And of course, the return window closed last week so now, I'm stuck with it. I will never buy another Lenovo anything! Unless you plan on using a mouse with this laptop, don't buy this. The touchpad hasn't worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning, I thought perhaps it was just a bit of a quirk since most touchpads I've worked with have some inherent oddities. This one however, is now very loose and I have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work, Then suddenly, I can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own. Today, it hasn't worked at all more than it has. The laptop has 4G and a 2.9g processor and it's slower than the four year old Toshiba I replaced. It hangs, freezes and just isn't working properly. I have now been waiting almost a minute for the computer management window to open! Though I don't have much installed, I only have 96 of the 278G left! I have no idea what's taking up all the room, it doesn't make sense. Most of my things are stored in the cloud. I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, if you want to spend $400+ on a laptop, don't buy this one! It's definitely not worth the money.\"]"

      "Bought it for my wife as a birthday present having owned a Dell in the past which was a great computer.\n",
      "This clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered.\n",
      "It would have a full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for 5 minutes.\n",
      "I promptly sent it back for an exchange thinking this was just a bad one and surely the next one would be fine.\n",
      "The second one, after a little over a month, refused to turn on even with a full charge.\n",
      "And I have pictures on there with no way to retrieve them!\n",
      "What a lemon!!\n",
      "Sells for the same as a netbook without sacrificing size.\n",
      "My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen.\n",
      "Great wifi too.\n",
      "The screen is a little glary, and I hated the clicking buttons, but I got used to them.\n",
      "It's truly a great laptop for the price.\n",
      "I built my own gaming pc with a intel i5-4590 in it and a gtx 760 so I know what crazy performance on a computer can come to.\n",
      "However, this laptop far exceeded my expectations when I bought it for college, I only use Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essentials, run a virus scan maybe once a week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years.\n",
      "For $250, which is as much as my graphics card alone cost, this laptop is an incredible value.\n",
      "It is quite impressive at multitasking, which really surprised me.\n",
      "I can have tabs open while playing YouTube videos and it handles it impressively well.\n",
      "BUT I should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen, it's certainly good enough for the average person, but if you're used to good screens this may bother you a bit, but it's certainly not unbearable by anyone's standards.\n",
      "If you want to game, this thing can handle League of Legends on medium-low settings, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for gaming.\n",
      "Overall, a great laptop for simply doing basic things and web-browsing.\n",
      "Would definitely recommend for those who are \"technologically ignorant\"\n",
      "The laptop itself is very good, it could be better, but not bad at all for it's price point.\n",
      "It does everything I need.\n",
      "The big deal with this was Windows 7.\n",
      "I had searched everywhere for a Windows 7 laptop, and all I could find was that awful Windows 8.\n",
      "When I saw this I grabbed it.\n",
      "It has met all my needs.\n",
      "First, it does not have a push button to open the lid.\n",
      "It is held in place magnetically.\n",
      "There is a little indent to help open it - but good luck with that.\n",
      "Once open, the leading edge is razor sharp.\n",
      "This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design.\n",
      "Using this machine is like a mild form of torture.\n",
      "In the shop, these MacBooks are encased in a soft rubber enclosure - so you will never know about the razor edge until you buy it, get it home, break the seal and use it (very clever con).\n",
      "The much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is a nightmare.\n",
      "I lost two items I was working on until I figured out what was happening.\n",
      "Also, the space bar makes a noisy click every time you use it.\n",
      "I hate to say this, but if I could take this back to the shop and get my money back, then I would.\n",
      "It is absolutely horrible to use, despite all its so called advanced features.\n",
      "I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use.\n",
      "Buy this if you like being tortured, teased, frustrated and wasting twice as much time as you spent using your old Mac.\n",
      "It's a bummer and one out of five is being kind.\n",
      "My Mac has gone from being a trusted friend to an adversary.\n",
      "I'm going to try and keep my old G4 on the road for as long as possible.\n",
      "In due course, I'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.\n",
      "This is a great value for the money.\n",
      "We purchased this as a back up computer after our more expensive HP needed to be repaired.\n",
      "This is a great computer.\n",
      "We haven't had any problems with it at all.\n",
      "The body is a bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up.\n",
      "Overall though, for the money spent it's a great deal.\n",
      "My husband got me this for Chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work after 2 days.\n",
      "So we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it didn't work.\n",
      "I went with him and we picked this one.\n",
      "It is made better, thicker, and all out tough!\n",
      "I droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and IT is still working with NO issues!\n",
      "I love the easy to see screen, and It works well for work, persoal or just play.\n",
      "I tell everyone I see out looking to get this or another Toshiba.\n",
      "My dad has one of the very first Toshibas ever made, yes its abit slow now but still works well and i hooked to my ethernet!\n",
      "My friends or children use that when they need to borrow the Net =) When I out grow this Meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one ANd I will be buying only TOSHIBA!\n",
      "I just love this lap top, I just wish it were all silver or they had all black.\n",
      "That is my only complaint!\n",
      "LOVE THIS LAPTOP WONDERFUL PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET!\n",
      "WOULD PAY MORE FOR IT IF I HAD TOO!\n",
      "Okay, let's just start out by saying I am in no way a computer techy.\n",
      "I am a wife, mom and a school teacher and a college student.\n",
      "Trying to balance all of my roles leaves very little time for me to do anything, so I want to manage my time I do have to be the most efficient.\n",
      "I work on a PC at home and have used Pc all through college.\n",
      "I use the computer to basically check emails, surf the web, print coupons and for my college papers.\n",
      "I was getting extrememly frustrated when I would want to do these simple taks that I would have to wait and wait and wait for things to download or virus that would clog up my PC.\n",
      "It would take up too much time to do reaearch for my papers and I would be up hours-just because the computer was too slow.\n",
      "My brother is a computer wiz and would laugh at me because he used an Apple.\n",
      "Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and ordered my Apple.\n",
      "Yes, I thought the expese was a little much, but I now realize you get what you pay for.\n",
      "I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use.\n",
      "I've had to call Apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful, english speaking (from Vancouver) techs that walked me through the processes to help me.\n",
      "I can't say enough of how satisfied I am with their product and help aftermarket.\n",
      "Money and time well spent!\n",
      "Highly recommended!\n",
      "With today's company fighting over marketshare, its a shame that ASUS can get away with the inept staff answering thephone.\n",
      "I agree with the previous comment that ASUS TECH SUPPORT IS HORRIBLE WHICH IS A CON IN MY OPINION.\n",
      "Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.\n",
      "Call tech support, standard email the form and fax it back in to us.\n",
      "I called back to ensure that received it, they had.\n",
      "But no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it ON THEIR WEBSITE!!!\n",
      "Frustrated I hung up and tried to call back 3 days later to be told that it takes 2-3 days for turnaround time.\n",
      "This was the 3rd day and part still had not been shipped.\n",
      "Asked the customer service rep.\n",
      "If it's not shipped on the next business day, called on a Friday they are closed on weekends, what was the next step.\n",
      "The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.\n",
      "Was searching online for a power supply when I found this site.\n",
      "I'm tired of the inept service.\n",
      "If you are looking for a netbook pc DO NOT BUY FROM ASUS!!!\n",
      "Unless you want to be inconvenienced with a non working power supply which you can't find a replacement for because they made the attachment so small.\n",
      "I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THIS EXPERIENCE.\n",
      "HOW DOES THE POWER SUPPLY NOT WORK!!!\n",
      "I spoke with a service rep at Micro Center and his girlfriend is having the same problem with her power adapter, so it's not just an isolated incident!!!\n",
      "I bought this laptop the moment unibody product came to the market.\n",
      "I also bought one for my wife, and 3 for my office.\n",
      "They are wonderful, but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat.\n",
      "I burned my leg, after lifting it from my desk, and for less than 5 second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table, so I can place it there.\n",
      "I had to call Apple 19 times (each time 40 to 75 minutes on the phone), and take it to their store for evaluations, and diagnostics, 5 times.\n",
      "This is what they told me: It heats up, and that is the reason we no longer call them laptops, and simply categorize them as portables.\n",
      "You might think, I am new in this game, but I am a gadget lover, and have had more than 2 dozens laptops in the past 15 years, and none gets this hot, that fast.\n",
      "I also experience the same with my MacBook Air.\n",
      "So you might ask, what did Apple do for me?\n",
      "For my burn thigh which has put a permanent mark on my skin (it happened 7 months ago) they offered me an ITouch 8Gig (you know it is a bit insulating when a company this rich, offer a loyal customer like me, a bottom of their product line as a gift for events like this).\n",
      "Steve Jobs, probably needs help and donations, and cannot afford a reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby.\n",
      "The lesson learned here is: It does not pay to by this loyal to any brand, since all of them are there to simply  to make as much money as possible, as fast as they can, and in this day and age, the customer no longer is right all the times.\n",
      "Sad very SAD.\n",
      "From the start, when you open the box you see a completely different class of machine.\n",
      "The ease in which you set everything up is such that a child could do it.\n",
      "The screen is bright and clear, the operating system is solid and friendly to a novice.\n",
      "Fast, fast and fast, the web pages just fly by.\n",
      "I had my IWORKS, Itunes, Email, MS Office, network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour.\n",

      "I can hardly wait to see whats around the next corner.\n",
      "My Iphone synced right up just like a person would expect, unlike the PCs in our lives.\n",
      "If only Bill Gates would read some of what is said here MS would do a better job.\n",
      "If your time is worth anything to you, if you are tired of rebooting, reformatting, reinstalling, trying to find drivers, if you want a computer to work for you for a change, make the change to this computer.\n",
      "It is light and the battery last a very long time.\n",
      "Very fast boot up and shut down.\n",

      "I'm so glad that I have.\n",
      "It's been a very easy transition moving my Windows created files over to the Mac.\n",
      "So far I haven't lost any quality or information.\n",
      "I have a little bit of a learning curve with the keyboard shortcuts.\n",
      "But other than that, I really am loving the quality and speed.\n",
      "I tell everyone that I know, friends, family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer i have ever used.\n",
      "The computer blinks it shuts off at will.\n",
      "The letter A stopped working after the first week.\n",
      "when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.\n",
      "not the day received.\n",
      "so the fact that the computer does not work on the 24 twenty fourth day is my fault.\n",
      "they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem.\n",
      "they have not sent a new one nor called.\n",
      "i spent eight hundred dollars from a giant paper weight that looks good on a bus.\n",
      "then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east.\n",
      "So when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with a bunch of people you cant understand.\n",
      "Then to make matters worst, there is noone that they can transfer you to.\n",
      "its sad because their commercials are great.\n",
      "I purchased a Toshiba Satellite M60 (with harman/kardon speakers!) in December of 2005.\n",
      "It still serves me well both in business and home needs.\n",

      "I am totally satisfied with my little toshie!\n",
      "I've always sworn by dell.\n",
      "My very first laptop was a dell and it never failed me.\n",
      "It was stubborn as hell, no amount of dust or slipping to the ground phased it.\n",
      "It worked super fast and got the job done.\n",
      "So with this new order, all the upgrades and windows 8 really caught my eye and I got this for the long haul.\n",
      "I am not ultra tech savvy but I can tell when it works slow!\n",
      "All I needed this for was to do some typing and simple internet browsing and maybe watching netflix here and there.\n",
      "I barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load.\n",
      "I know its not my internet connection because I have an HP as well and its like lightening even with the mass of data and info I have on it.\n",
      "I'm so disappointed.\n",
      "If what you need is a machine to do some surfing, email checking, word processing, and watching a movie or two, this is the machine you want.\n",
      "It's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box.\n",
      "If you want a little more custom ability, drop a few bucks and upgrade to one of the more robust versions of Win 7 and grab a 2GB stick of memory to spice it all up a bit more.\n",
      "(I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $50)\n",
      "Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours, or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents.\n",
      "My ONLY issues are:\n",
      "the screen/video resolution won't increase to a higher resolution then 1024 x 60\n",
      "That being said, it still runs video in full screen decently.\n",
      "The sound is a bit quiet if you're on a plane, this can easily be overcome with a decent pair of head phones.\n",
      "Bottom line, I doubt you'd be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine.\n",
      "I simply got tired of a bad computer like windows with its constant freezing and anti-virus.\n",
      "I got my MacBook Pro because I wanted to do all the stuff I need to do without worrying about the system quitting on me or freezing for a few minutes.\n",
      "Now that I have it I see that I really needed this for much more.\n",
      "I run Dreamweaver, Final Cut Pro 7, Photoshop, Safari, Firefox, MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time.\n",
      "I have not had a problem with the applications quitting or freezing.\n",

      "Would not buy it again.\n",
      "The worst computer I have ever laid my eyes upon.\n",
      "Firstly, it has no leds to let you know what is going on, no cap lock, no hard drive indicator, nothing.\n",
      "Ok, one light to let you know if the damn thing is on.\n",
      "The biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it, even when the strength bar is filled.\n",
      "Also, when you try to download a large file, like a video, it will start out normally, downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec, making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless.\n",
      "Get a probook instead.\n",
      "Killer computer.\n",

      "My house is now 100% Macbook.\n",
      "The Macbook starts fast, doesn't crash, has a fantastic display, is small and light (I have the 13.3\" model), and isn't always complaining about updates, lost connections, errors, blue screens, etc.\n",
      "THIS is what a laptop is supposed to be.\n",
      "The only pro to this computer is it was under $600!\n",
      "Everything is falling apart internally and externally.\n",
      "I am not much of a computer techie, so I can understand some of the internal problems, though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program.\n",
      "With in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down.\n",
      "I am constantly trying to uninstall programs, clean cookies, and delete unused files.\n",
      "Nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a virus scan.\n",
      "More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection, or the page can't be displayed.\n",
      "It takes me approximately 3 tries to get to each site, then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works.\n",
      "I have Vista, so I am unable to install and uninstall  some programs.\n",
      "I can't even install one of the 3 printers I have in my house so I am unable to print.\n",

      "I'm so glad I purchased a Mac and not another PC!!!\n",
      "They definitely have a superior product!\n",
      "From the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer!\n",
      "The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.\n",
      "The track pad to me is what really stands out though, you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad, awesome thinking Apple!\n",
      "Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing, which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion.\n",
      "The OS is also very user friendly, even for those that switch from a PC, with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS!\n",

      "Two of the times was in one month.\n",
      "I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it.\n",
      "Toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done.\n",
      "I would tell the technician I knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and I had to go through a bunch of junk to get them to tell me I needed to send the computer in.\n",
      "This computer that I have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions.\n",
      "As well as having the plug in the computer come loose.\n",
      "This has happened three times so far.\n",
      "Two times with in one month.\n",
      "I am not one to throw things like this around but it is a laptop so carrying it around does seem to mean it will be jerked possibly a little, while driving a car and carrying it into where ever you are using it.\n",
      "So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.\n",
      "It still seems to be a little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there.\n",
      "The apple MacBook is the best investment that I have ever made.\n",

      "VERY disappointing:\n",
      "I was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain Flash.\n",
      "About 1/2 of the sites I need to visit because of my work contain some type of Flash.\n",
      "Web access through the 3G network is so slow, it's very frustrating and VERY DISAPPOINTING.\n",
      "One of the primary reasons why I purchased an IPad was to store photographs so that I could show to my customers.\n",
      "After purchasing this thing, I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.\n",
      "I go to purchase it on line, and I find out that the device will not be available until almost two months later!\n",
      "I now realize that my $900 would have been better spent on a Windows laptop.\n",
      "i would never go back any more, i love this computer so much and i would recommend it to everyone.\n",
      "i use my mac all the time, i love the software, the way it takes a short time to load things, how easy it is to use and most of all how you don't have to worry about viruses.\n",
      "With a mac you don't have to worry about antivirus software or firewall, it's so wonderful.\n",
      "this computer is a little more expensive than any pc but it will last you longer and it worth every penny.\n",
      "All apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything, no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed.\n",
      "this computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.\n",
      "everything about a mac is wonderful, it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system, but you will learn fast and its all worth it.\n",
      "I know that everyone thinks Macs are overpriced and overrated, but once you get past the initial expense you'll find that they're worth every penny (besides, there's always the financing plan that Best Buy offers).\n",
      "The 13\" MacBook Pro is portable, durable, and very capable.\n",
      "It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours.\n",
      "It's also very energy efficient, running on a quarter of the power it takes to run a 60 Watt lightbulb.\n",
      "It's graphics aren't bad at all, for the lower end of the MacBook Pro spectrum, easily capable of running StarCraft II and other games with comparable graphics.\n",
      "It's also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing).\n",
      "The operating system and user interface is very intuitive, and the large multi-touch track pad is amazing.\n",
      "Typically, when I purchase a new laptop I always end up using an external mouse for convenience.\n",
      "However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you're gaming).\n",
      "Still, this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work.\n",
      "They also have a longer service life than other computers (I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).\n",
      "The Toshiba laptop I am using is easier to use than most I have tried.\n",
      "The games included are very good games.\n",
      "I am finding my way around this laptop better than my last one.\n",
      "I would highly recommend this one to my friends\n",
      "I bought it for really cheap also and it's AMAZING.\n",
      "Easy to start up and does not overheat as much as other laptops.\n",
      "Recommended to people as their first laptop.\n",
      "I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for.\n",
      "The 13\" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.\n",
      "The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.\n",
      "I would recommend anyone to buy from pcconnection express.\n",
      "Speakers doesn't sound that great.\n",
      "The battery life also doesn't keep up with the claim but still I think macbook is much ahead from the rest of the pack.\n",
      "Plain and simple, it(laptop) runs great and loads fast.\n",
      "Easy to carry, can be taken anywhere, can be hooked up to printers,headsets.\n",
      "Love that it doesn't take up space like a regular computer.\n",
      "dell is a decently made pc.\n",
      "although its windows vista compared to windows xp sucks.\n",
      "the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.\n",
      "with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.\n",
      "so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop.\n",
      "I purchased this laptop while on a business trip to keep up with my email.\n",
      "I had left my regular laptop at home and needed something to use while out of town .\n",
      "The price and features more than met my needs.\n",
      "I love WIndows 7 which is a vast improvment over Vista.\n",
      "The feature are good enough for what I need.\n",
      "I have owned macbook pros since 2005 and this is the best yet!\n",
      "I have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models.\n",
      "I have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me.\n",
      "The screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use, very important for use quick typers.\n",
      "Navigation through the computer is far superior compared to Windows operating systems, as well.\n",
      "Overall, this is a wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase!\n",
      "I absolutely love my mac!\n",
      "I can't imagine my life without it anymore!\n",
      "It's perfect for everything and runs faster than an average pc!\n",
      "beautifully done, the computer is amazingly faster compared to other version of macbook pro i have had in the past.\n",
      "I am also glad it doesnt get too hot when left on for an extended period of time.\n",
      "The battery life is good, even with using high profile software like Sibelius 7 for a good half of the day.\n",
      "Overall, the performance and specs are definitely great for the price compared to other laptop of the same price, which make this Apple purchase a worthwhile one.\n",
      "This a starter notebook.\n",
      "The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.\n",
      "The notebook is lacking a HDMI port and a S-video port that would enable one to hook it to a TV.\n",
      "If you check you will find the same notebook with the above missing ports and a dual core AMD or Intel processor.\n",
      "I would not recommend this to anyone wanting a notebook expecting the performance of a Desktop it does not meet the expectations.\n",
      "It is a cheap throw together.\n",
      "Save your money and go for a better device.\n",
      "Has a 5-6 hour battery life.\n",
      "Much faster than my old windows laptop that died on me.\n",
      "It is easy to use and lightweight.\n",
      "Was very much worth the price i paid.\n",
      "Terrific value for the money.\n",
      "Love the key layout and the built-in mouse pad - all work well and are properly sized.\n",
      "Was easy to get up and running and comes with Windows 7 Pro (my favorite operating system so far, do not  like Windows 8).\n",
      "Highly recommended.\n",
      "I got the black MacBook two years ago and have never regretted it.\n",
      "It was a hard decision for me since the MacBook Pro looked so appealing.\n",
      "But to be honest, I don't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming.\n",
      "So this was great for me.\n",
      "It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs.\n",
      "Plus it is small and reasonably light so I can take it with me to and from work.\n",
      "I also travel with it and it never gives me any problems.\n",
      "It was also cheaper than the Pro which made it even more appealing to me.\n",
      "Sadly Apple has discontinued this MacBook, I think it was never super popular since it fell somewhere in between the cheapest white model and the smaller Pros.\n",
      "But I am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it.\n",
      "I look forward to years of use, it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well.\n",
      "Shiny\n",
      "This Laptop is the Best of the best!\n",
      "The Awesomest of the awesomest.\n",
      "It is so great, I can Hardly ever take my hands off it!\n",
      "My friends are in awe every time they come over!\n",
      "I got it for Christmas, and I was so excited to set it up!\n",
      "It is super fast, and always loads.\n",
      "I am just amazed.\n",
      "The only bad part is the size/weight.\n",
      "It's like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it's GREAT!\n",
      "If you don't like fingerprints, this might not be the laptop for you.\n",
      "It super shiny, so you can see the fingerprints easily.\n",
      "It doesn't bother me though.\n",
      "It doesn't heat up like my old laptop.\n",
      "All for such a great price.\n",
      "It's color is even cool.\n",
      "Another Great thing is the Beast graphics.\n",
      "They are so realistic I am just speechless.\n",

      "The speed is incredible and I am more than satisfied.\n",
      "Yes, a Mac is much more money than the average laptop out there, but there is no comparison in style, speed and just cool factor.\n",
      "I think this computer is super lame.\n",
      "I dont understand how anyone can think this is a great product worth purchasing.\n",
      "I went to my local Best Buy looking for a new laptop since mine broke.\n",
      "I decided to get this pile of crap on a whim and totally freaking regret it.\n",
      "It doesnt work worth a damn.\n",
      "The display is beyond horrible.\n",
      "I can not even read what I am writing half of the time.\n",
      "There are so many things wrong with this product, it just makes me want to set my self on fire!\n",
      "I would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage.\n",
      "I know there are way better laptops out there for the same price, and why spend money on shit when you can go out and get yourself a perfectly decent laptop that doesnt suck total monkey balls.\n",
      "Not to mention it has shit gigs.\n",
      "I could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage.\n",
      "Do yourself a favor and invest in a few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop.\n",
      "Purchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out.\n",
      "After the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace.\n",
      "Before we got this laptop, had a compaq pasaro for 5 years with no problems.\n",
      "After the bad experience with this computer went back to compaq.\n",
      "I will have to say that I love my MacBook Pro!\n",
      "It fires up in the morning in less than 30 seconds and I have never had any issues with it freezing.\n",

      "This is now my 3rd MacBook Pro and I really honestly love it!\n",
      "The newer black keyboard took a little bit away from the previous gray one which looked really slick, but it is still a great notebook!\n",
      "The MacBook Pro is very sturdy and versatile.\n",
      "I love it!\n",
      "I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more!\n",
      "We are addicted to the Mac.\n",
      "This is a great laptop and I would recommend it to anyone.\n",
      "The OS takes some getting used to especially after being a Windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it!\n",
      "Great laptop that offers many great features!\n",
      "Lightweight and the screen is beautiful!\n",
      "I had meant to purchase the NB205 and bought this one by accident (long story).\n",
      "I am not going to sit here and complain about it not having a cd drive and what not because it is a netbook, it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get a laptop.\n",
      "Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone.\n",
      "So I called customer support (which is good too) and they went through it and it is just a safety feature and it does not affect performance at all, I just chose to hide the message.\n",
      "I have had the netbook for 2 months and I love it, I read some reviews that say netbooks are slow but it does not seem any slower than the other computers I use.\n",
      "Also the speakers are not very loud, But it is a netbook.\n",
      "Would HIGHLY recommend this netbook though.\n",
      "Ok, this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by Apple.\n",
      "The case is carved out of a single block of aluminum.\n",
      "Although I opted for the lowest end MacBook Pro, this thing holds its own.\n",
      "The processor screams, and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions, most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.\n",
      "That is how it is able to function better than any other PC.\n",
      "I have recommended this laptop to everyone I know who is buying one.\n",
      "I like it so much, I bought another just for my wife.\n",
      "I just bought this computer from the Apple Store, and I couldn't be more impressed with it.\n",
      "It has a stunning retina display, and is very fast.\n",
      "The solid-state memory makes it a lot faster than previous MacBook Pro models that used a spinning hard drive.\n",
      "This computer is good for anything, and it has really superseded my high expectations.\n",
      "Also, the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear, and everything is just sleek and smooth.\n",
      "The HD display is sensational, and now watching any movie is a very enjoyable experience for me.\n",
      "No hardware issues, as is common with any Apple product.\n",
      "Great product, and couldn't be happier with it.\n",
      "Meh...but cheap.\n",
      "I bought this so that I could sit on the couch and surf internet with a larger screen than iPad was offering.\n",
      "The reviews at the time in late July 2014 were mostly positive and it was the best selling laptop with almost 4 star review...\n",
      "The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus.\n",
      "Now the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic (medium low grade) plastic.\n",
      "So if you don't have kids, or not in high school or don't accidently sit on it, it should be fine.\n",
      "Now the speed is disappointing.\n",
      "Start up is fine  maybe 20 secs at most, but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times.\n",
      "Even for a 4GB RAM it barely chugs with 3 tabs open.\n",
      "I tried all the Window updates (this worked for a couple of HP laptops I7in that I bought later at BB) to see if it could remove the drag, it did not.\n",
      "Really at this point I am trying to confirm if the RAM can be upgraded to see if I can do that to help.\n",
      "Couple that with lack of inbuilt Bluetooth, dvd drive you are looking at a close tie (or even a loss) compared with the other laptops on sale in mid to late August 2014.\n",
      "The HP laptops 17in (with i3 core and AMD) I mentioned before from the other big electronic BB store smoked this one even before I updated windows and upped the RAM.\n",
      "But alas they were gifts...and what is a gift if not given?\n",
      "All in all I wish I had waited a bit.\n",
      "But then again hindsight is 20/20.\n",
      "Bought a usb dvd rW drive but have not used it yet.\n",
      "Let me start with the good:So awesome.\n",
      "Great OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.\n",
      "This is my second MacBook.\n",
      "The first one I had was a 2006 model, not the Pro.\n",
      "I fell in love with it.\n",
      "This one has had the same effect.\n",
      "I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion, so I kind of knew what I was getting, but hadn't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new multi-touch features.\n",
      "The improvements to the OS have been relatively gradual, but substantive.\n",
      "The feel of this machine compared to the old MacBook is far superior.\n",
      "The Unibody construction is solid, sleek and beautiful.\n",
      "It is everything I'd hoped it would be from a look and feel standpoint, but somehow a bit more sturdy.\n",
      "For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy.\n",
      "It's still beautiful and has better color reproduction than I could ever expect from a notebook.\n",
      "The reflectiveness of the display is only a minor inconvenience if you work in a controlled-lighting environment like me (I prefer it dark) or if you can crank up the brightness.\n",
      "My real problem with it?\n",
      "The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.\n",
      "I challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than 2.5 hrs out of it.\n",
      "The first full charge of this battery got me only about 2 full hours.\n",
      "Enabling the battery timer is useless.\n",
      "The \"Time remaining\" goes from 4 hours plus to less than 2 hours over the span of about 10 minutes.\n",
      "It's a joke.\n",
      "It's so bad that I'm thinking I only got half a battery or something.\n",
      "I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.\n",
      "This ain't it.\n",
      "My only other complaint is that it gets really hot.:-)\n",
      "If you buy this - don't go into it expecting 7 hrs of battery life, and you'll be perfectly satisfied.\n",
      "I previously owned an HP desktop and a Dell laptop.\n",
      "Both computers started acting extremely slow within the first year of owning them.\n",
      "I have never had any issues or problems with my MacBook Pro so far, and it is still as fast as it was when I first bought it.\n",
      "I especially like the backlit keyboard.\n",
      "It makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier.\n",
      "It is also very lightweight, making transporting this computer very easy.\n",
      "The graphics on this computer are also stellar - very clear and vivid.\n",
      "The applications are also very easy to find and maneuver, much easier than any other computer I have ever owned.\n"

      "My MacBook Pro is no exception.\n",
      "On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad.\n",

      "I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the trackpad.\n",
      "The display is incredibly bright, much brighter than my PowerBook and very crisp.\n",
      "The computer runs very fast with no problems and the iLife software that comes with it (iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iTunes, GarageBand) is all very helpful as well.\n",
      "I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations (similar to Microsoft Office).\n",
      "I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well.\n",
      "I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get a new laptop who is willing to spend a little more money to get great quality!\n",
      "Great laptop from Apple!\n",

      "Very long-life battery (up to 10-11 hours depending on how you configure power level settings).\n",
      "I upgraded the memory and replaced the base Windows 7 Starter to Win 7 Home, and it runs just fine.\n",
      "I play a lot of casual games online, and the touchpad is very responsive.\n",
      "The only thing I wish this had was the option to turn off the touchpad with a button like my big 16\" laptop does.\n",
      "I wouldn't play a first-person shooter with this, mind, but if you wanted to run MS Office, email, chat, download a video, listen to music from a certain fruit-named music store, and were looking for a highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in, I'd highly recommend checking this out.\n",
      "The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.\n",
      "Additional caveat: the base installation comes with some Toshiba-specific software that may or may not be to a user's liking.\n",

      "My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.\n",
      "This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.\n",
